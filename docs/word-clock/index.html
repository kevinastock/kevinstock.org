The entire front is a single 3D-printed piece that acts as the display, LED adapter, light baffle, and diffuser. Achieving that in a single print was tricky, we had to manually clean between every layer to prevent contamination, but it worked. The model was generated with OpenSCAD using my <a href=/openscad-python>OpenSCAD Python Wrapper</a>.<p>Internally, a TinyPICO drives a grid of LEDs, fetching time via NTP. Configuration is handled by an accelerometer: tipping the clock adjusts brightness, manually adjusts the timezone, or resets WiFi. The backplate, secured with heat-set inserts, holds the electronics and includes strain relief for the USB cable.<p>Not everything went smoothly. Printing took many attempts to avoid light leaks, a firmware bug fried two boards, and a couple of finished clocks mysteriously stopped working. If I revisit the project, I’d love to CNC the body and design a proper PCB instead of protoboarding. But for now, I'm happy with it.<p><a href=https://github.com/kevinastock/word-clock>Github</a><p>Update: <a href=/Website/web-clock.html>A vibe-coded html version of the clock</a> <a href=/Website/Name%20Smile.otf></a></main><hr><p class=page-date><i> Last updated: <time datetime=2026-01-01> January 2026 </time> </i><footer>🚀</footer>
